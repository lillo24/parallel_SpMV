# Sparse Matrix-Vector Multipication with OpenMP

Parallel implementation of Sparse Matrix–Vector Multiplication (SpMV) in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format on a multicore platform using OpenMP. 
The goal is to study throughput and strong scaling compared to a sequential baseline and to understand when parallelization is actually beneficial on real sparse matrices
